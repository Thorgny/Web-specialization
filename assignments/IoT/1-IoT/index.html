                    <em>Who coined the term 'Internet of Things'?</em>
                    <p>
                        Kevin Ashton of Proctor & Gamble did so in 1999.

                    <em>What is the fundamental prerequisite for IoT?</em>
                    <p>
                        That devices you want to be a part of IoT can connect to the internet and do at least one of the three:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect information and then send it</li>
                            <li>Receive information and act on it</li>
                            <li>Or both of the above</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>What is an IP address?</em>
                    <p>
                        An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 
                        An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>What kinds of IP-adresses exist?</em>
                    <p>
                        Two versions of the <em>Internet Protocol</em> exist (IPv4 and IPv6).
                        But the two "kinds" are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Private IP-address</li>
                            <li>Public IP-address (static and dynamic)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Why are IP-adresses interesting in IoT?</em>
                    <p>
                        Because on our own network various IoT-devices has a unique private IP-address. 
                        This is done so the items can find each other (or be found) on the network.
