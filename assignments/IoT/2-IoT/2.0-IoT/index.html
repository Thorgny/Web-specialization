                    <h2>What is the videos definition of IoT?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is when you connect everyday things with software/sensors to the internet and allow them to
                        exchange and collect data with each other.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h2>He uses the term platform, what is that?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The thing a bunch of IoT-devices act on/with. Like a house or a car, there are a bunch of
                        controls within those platforms (speedometers, gps, ac, lights, locks etc).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>What does he mean by:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Interact?</h3>
                            <p>
                                If devices can interact (speak) to each other, like humans, then combined with the other
                                factors below, the IoT systems can interdependt on each other. It sounds like a fragile
                                state (like a house of cards). But it opens up a world of possibilities.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Contribute?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Whether devices (like humans) can share the knowledge they collect, and send it to other
                                devices. Like person A can contribute knowledge to person B if person A knows something
                                B doesn't.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Collaborate?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Animals (humans included) have the ability to work together to solve problems. So do
                                devices in IoT. Collecting and sharing data is how.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <h2>The video outlines some benefits? It mentions <em>resource utilization, minimizing human effort,
                            saving of time, artificial intelligence through the use of IoT, improved security</em>. Who
                        reaps each of those benefits?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Humans do. Even if you don't use IoT yourself you are more than likely dependant on a system
                        that does utilize it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Features of IoT? Try to generalize. I know Fridays video will talk about gadgets, and today you
                        have seen a weather sensor. So let your imagination take you away with the knowledge you have
                        thus far.</h2>
                    <p>
                        It can act as an enhancer of all technology. It can make it better and smarter because it is
                        all-encompassing and therefor you can make it collect/share pretty much all info helping
                        existing technologies improve by offering new or just better (more precise) services.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h2>He uses the terms Connect, Analyze, and Integrate? What does connect mean in the context?</h2>
                    <p>
                        You need to be able to connect the things around you to the IoT-platform.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Analyze? Of what? Always, or dependant of context?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When connected items have collected various data it needs to be analyzed (to pick out what other
                        connected things can use instead of just sending a haystack of unorganized info to other
                        devices).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Integrate? In this part he mentions the concept of REST API, without too much research please
                        find out what it is.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Finally it has to act on info collected. Say you have a smart-fridge; you take a carton of milk
                        out leaving only one behind (collected by fridge via sensors). Based on previous behavior it
                        knows that you drink a lot of milk (because Amazon's Alexa fx has your purchase history). By
                        those to IoT devices working together they might deduct that the Alexa needs to order more milk.
                        Or at least ask YOU if it should. In this example two IoT devices just <em>interacted</em> with
                        one another, <em>contributed</em> knowledge to each other, and <em>collaborated</em> on getting
                        a task done. YOU reaped the benefits of it as it saved you time and energy by not having to
                        check the fridge only to realize you don't have enough milk and then go to the store.

                    <h2>A Raspberry Pi is a computer. It is a useful gadget in IoT, not a necessary gadget. What is its
                        role?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is a very small, inexpensive, barebones computer. It is a single-board computer, meaning it
                        only consists
                        of the motherboard (no graphic cards and such). It is meant for basic computing science and to
                        write code on. <br>
                        It is customizable as various attachments/boards can be added to add functionalities (ie.
                        SenseHat).
